Currently working on a degree in Computer Sciences through Brigham Young University Idaho.

I am nearly finished obtaining a certificate in Web and Computer Programming through Brigham Yougn University Idaho.

With my current education, I have beginner experience in Python, C#, and Javascript. I have intermediate experience in Html and CSS.

I will be serving a two-year mission for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints after I get my Web and Computer Programming Certificate. 

When I come home from my mission, I plan to finish getting the degree I am working on.
